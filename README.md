# LC-SellableBodies
Lethal Company mod for selling bodies.

this will be maintained but not expanded on. If you want to see additions you're more than welcome to make a pull request.

Known issues:
Be careful dropping / killing enemies on the catwalk things. Item collision in this game works of one single point in 3d space and the items/bodies are so big there's a good chance dropping or killing on a catwalk the collision point will be over the edge and the body will fall down.
